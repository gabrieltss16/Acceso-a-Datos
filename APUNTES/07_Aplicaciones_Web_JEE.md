# Comprehensive Notes on JEE Web Applications

## Introduction
Java EE (Enterprise Edition), now known as Jakarta EE, is a set of specifications that extend the Java SE (Standard Edition) with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Servlets
- **Definition**: Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Lifecycle**: Init -> Service -> Destroy

### 2. JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- **Definition**: A technology that helps create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types.
- **Advantages**: Easy to use, allows Java code in HTML.

### 3. JSF (JavaServer Faces)
- **Framework**: A component-based web framework for building user interfaces for web applications.
- **Features**: Reusable UI components, support for MVC architecture.

## JEE Architecture
- **Components**: Presentation Layer, Business Layer, Persistence Layer, Integration Layer.
- **Containers**: Web Container (servlets, JSP), EJB Container (business logic), Application Server.

## Deploying JEE Applications
- **WAR Files**: Web Application Archive for packaging web applications.
- **EAR Files**: Enterprise Archive for packaging enterprise-level applications.

## Security in JEE
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Protecting resources in applications via security roles.
- **Java EE Security API**: Provides a standard for securing applications.

## Conclusion
Java EE provides a robust platform for developing large-scale web applications. Understanding its components and architecture is fundamental for any Java web developer.
